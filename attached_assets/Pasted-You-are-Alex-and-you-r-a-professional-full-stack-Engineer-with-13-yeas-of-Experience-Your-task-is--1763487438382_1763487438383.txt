You are Alex and you r a professional full-stack Engineer with 13 yeas of Experience . Your task is to **generate a fully functional, professional Next.js 15 portfolio website** based on the JSON content file, following production standards. The site must be **SSR-ready, multi-language, animated, responsive, and modular**, with a focus on a clean, modern design. Here are the requirements: --- ### **1. Project Architecture** - Use **Next.js 15** with TypeScript. - Pages are dynamic based on content.json. Do **not hardcode content**. - Implement **SSR for all pages** using route.ts or getServerSideProps to fetch content.json. - Provide .env.example with placeholders for: - EMAIL_SERVER - EMAIL_USER - EMAIL_PASSWORD - NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL - Ensure .env.local can override variables. --- ### **2. Multi-Language Support** - Support fr and en (from JSON). - Default language: fr. - Language toggle should **change text instantly** without page reload. - Use React Context or Zustand for managing active language state. - All pages, meta tags, buttons, and sections must respect the active language. --- ### **3. JSON-driven content** - All content must come from content.json: - Globals (siteName, jobTitle, location, email, phone, about, theme, socials, resumeUrl) - Pages (home, projects, about, contact) - Sections and components (HeroSection, SkillsSection, ProjectsSection, AboutSection, ContactSection) - use route.ts files to get content.json from data - use ssr - **Do not hardcode** text, titles, descriptions, or project details. --- ### **4. Design & Animations** - Preserve the existing **portfolio design**. - Use **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion** for animations. - Implement **loading screen animation** while pages fetch JSON. - Add **entrance animations** for each section on scroll. --- ### **5. Projects Section** - On homepage, show **3 featured projects** first. - Include a **“Show More” button** to reveal the rest of the projects. - On Projects page, implement **filtering by category** and **sorting (Newest, Oldest, Name)**. - Projects must show **title, description, technologies, image, live URL, GitHub URL**. - Projects loaded from JSON dynamically. --- ### **6. Contact Form** - Implement form with fields: name, email, subject, message. - Validate required fields. - On submit: - Send email to your configured email (EMAIL_USER) using **serverless function or API route**. - If the subject indicates **CV request**, send a notification email to you instead of the CV file. - Show **success/error messages** from JSON content. - Add **resend / retry functionality** for email submission. --- ### **7. Hire Me / Meeting Integration** - Add a **“Hire Me” or “Schedule Meeting” button** that links to an online meeting Calendly. --- ### **8. Analytics & Tracking** - All user actions (button clicks, form submissions, Show More, language toggle) are logged. - Logs are sent **automatically to Telegram** via bot. - Keep logs anonymous (no sensitive personal data). --- ### **9. Environment & Deployment** - Ready for **production deployment**. - Use .env.local for secrets, .env.example for template. - Optimize **image loading** (Next.js Image) and **code splitting**. - Use **React Query or SWR** for efficient data fetching if needed. --- ### **10. Instructions for AI** - Generate a **complete Next.js project structure**: pages, components, layouts, styles, API routes. - Create **modular components** for Hero, Skills, Projects, About, Contact. - Include **route.ts** for server-side JSON fetching. - Ensure **multi-language toggle** works globally. - Include **animations**, loading screens, and smooth transitions. - Use **content.json** as single source of truth for all content. - Provide **detailed comments** in code for maintainability. - Generate .env.example with instructions. --- ### **11. Extra Notes** - Keep design **exactly as in current portfolio**, do not change styling. - Make it **professional, production-ready, performant**. - Ensure **all features are fully functional**: multi-lang, SSR, Show More, contact email, CV request, Hire Me link, animations, tracking. - If something **cannot be implemented**, explain why and propose an alternative. --- End of instructions. Deliver **fully functional Next.js project ready to run**. Make sure **all content is dynamic from JSON** and **all interactions work**.
